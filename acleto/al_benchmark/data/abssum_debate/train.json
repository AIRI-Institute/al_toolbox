{"debate_id":"17852","claim":"Why a flat tax is fairer","argument_sentences":"Thus a flat tax is fairer as it equalized the basis on which everyone pays for access to equal services , and prevents a poorer majority from victimizing a wealthier minority through punitive rates of income tax for the wealthy , which may cause them to flee the country for other states with less taxation .\nSecondly this removes the ability of the majority of a population to engage in what the French economist Bastiat called ` legalized plunder ' , where they -LRB- as the majority of voters -RRB- assign higher percentages of income tax to the wealthy in order that the state may appropriate and redistribute it to them for their own use .\nWith a flat tax in place , there would be no ability for anyone to vote for a tax rise simply on other people and not on themselves , and thus such policies would receive more consideration and not be used by the majority simply to appropriate the property of others through the law .\nHowever , this parity can be achieved by everyone paying the same percentage of their income in tax to the government , and this is exactly what a flat tax is , and so equality in contribution to government services -LRB- mirroring equality in access to government services -RRB- is achieved .\nThis principle of equality is important for two reasons : firstly , if wealthier citizens feel they are being unfairly burdened by the current requirement that they pay higher percentages of their income to fund government services than those on lower incomes , they may feel a disincentive to work hard -LRB- which creates wealth for the whole economy -RRB- , or may even be driven abroad to states with lower rates of taxation or to tax havens .\nIn a welfare state such as the United Kingdom , everyone enjoys the same access to services provided by the government , and so it should stand to reason that everyone should also contribute equally to the funding of those services .\nAs not all individuals are equal in their wealth and income , it is impossible to do this on the basis of everyone paying in the exact same numerical amount of money .","debate_name":"This House Would introduce a flat tax","claim_id":"17852_2"}
{"debate_id":"17852","claim":"Why a flat tax is simpler:","argument_sentences":"This causes a number of problems .\nThe current system of ` progressive ' taxation whereby higher earners are taxed a higher percentage of their income requires the identification and administration of multiple different tax brackets spanning the entire spectrum of earnings in a nation .\nMoreover , the administration of multiple tax brackets is incredibly complicated and difficult , requiring every taxpayer to record their income and expenditure -LRB- in order to try and qualify for tax exemptions and ` loopholes ' -RRB- in meticulous detail and then to properly express this on lengthy and complicated government forms , a process which can cause anger , frustration and alienation amongst taxpayers .\nThe brackets themselves may be largely arbitrary cut-off lines based around round numbers , with no real justification as to why one person increasing their earnings by as little as 1000 should lead to them suddenly being propelled to a new tax bracket , when the actual difference to their income is negligible in overall terms .\nThis may be contrasted with a flat tax system by taking the example of taxes on salaries paid to employees by a company under both systems .\nIn order to try and prevent tax evasion , governments are consequently compelled to have large bureaucracies that oversee this process and comb through looking for fraud , a costly and lengthy process .\nHowever , under a flat tax , a tax collector could simply withhold the fixed flat tax rate -LRB- for example 20 % -RRB- of the total company 's payroll without needing to know what was paid to whom , as every pound is taxed at the same rate and thus it does not matter what goes to whom .\nIn the status quo , a tax collector must be aware in detail of exactly what is being paid to whom in order to ensure that everyone declares their income truthfully , allowing them to be placed in the correct bracket .\nThus the simplicity of a flat tax is a significant advantage .\nThis would allow for a massive simplification of tax forms , and for the down-scaling of the costly government departments dedicated to administering the different tax brackets .","debate_name":"This House Would introduce a flat tax","claim_id":"17852_1"}

Filmore -RRB- or , more recently , growing marijuana -LRB- Gonzales v.

''\nThis resolution would not require the targeting of all Muslims , but rather those who meet further profile characteristics .\nAs Dr Shaaz Mahboob , of British Muslims for Secular Democracy , said in 2010 : `` We have seen that certain types of people who fit a certain profile young men of a particular ethnic background have been engaged in terror activities , and targeting this sort of passenger would give people a greater sense of security .\nEffective profiling is based on the analysis of the appearance and behavior of a passenger and an inspection of the travelers itinerary and passport ; it does not and should not be based on race , religion , nationality or color of skin .\nPhilip Baum , editor of Aviation Security International , argues : `` I have been an ardent supporter of passenger profiling for many years .\nIt is the only solution that addresses the problems of the past as well as those of the future .\nAnd it works .\nTherefore until such security resources are used appropriately , we will never achieve a secure air transportation system , and terrorism and its awful human consequences will remain a constant threat and fear .\nWe require highly trained , streetwise , individuals who can make risk assessments of passengers as they arrive at the airport and determine which technology should be used for screening . ''\nIntelligent , well designed and responsive profiling systems study passengers behavior in-situ in addition to their background and appearance .\nDoes anyone seriously believe that we have better airport security than Israel ?\nIs our security record better than theirs ?\nAs Thomas Sowell , senior fellow at the Hoover Institution , argues : `` No country has better airport security than Israel and no country needs it more , since Israel is the most hated target of Islamic extremist terrorists .\nWe need an intelligent approach to aviation security that deploys common sense to the security checkpoint .\nThey profile .\nAs a consequence , these individuals may be subjected to the highest level of security screening , and in some cases , prevented from flying .\n` Security ' may be the excuse being offered for the outrageous things being done to American air travelers , but the heavy-handed arrogance and contempt for ordinary people that is the hallmark of this -LSB- G.

''\nThe fact is the majority of people who have carried out or planned these terror attacks have been Muslims .\nProfiling may have to be the price we have to pay .\nThe harm that results from failing to uphold the former is much , much greater than the harm that would attach to the later .\nThe state should accord a higher priority - when balancing the competing rights claims of citizens - to policies and powers that protect individuals from terrorist attacks than to protecting citizens from the transient feelings of victimisation and isolation that result from profiling .\nTherefore the state should protect the individual rights of its citizens by ensuring that they are protected first by instituting security profiling at airports .\nAccording to Michael Reagan , president of The Reagan Legacy Foundation : `` Political correctness killed innocent people at Fort Hood , an Army base in Texas , when Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan gunned down 13 people and wounded many others despite the fact that his fellow officers were aware of his attachment to radical Islamism and all that it implied .\nThe state has a duty to protect its citizens by ensuring that its security apparatus is effective and adaptable , even if this means running afoul of political correctness and the rights of those individuals affected .\nAs long as there is a net benefit to everyone of increased security , then individual rights are actually better protected , as everyone who travels has a greater chance of not being blown up .\nIt is the same political correctness that is stopping us today from doing what we truly need to be doing at airports and other public places : profiling all passengers .

''\nAlternatives to profiling are far more invasive and likely to be more offensive to Muslims than profiling would be .\nWith broad screening of all travelers for example there is likely to be less security as security resources are directs onto people who are not a threat so offending everybody rather than just a tiny minority .\nFor each search of a passenger who a profiler would regard as highly unlikely to engage in violent activity in plane or an airport , there is a near-negligible impact on security attention and resources .\nExpanding the use of profiling will help to restrict the use of invasive security monitoring strategies such as body scanners and intimate , full contact pat-downs .\nBody-scanning and patting-down all travelers , including older disabled men and women , is an excessive , expensive and humiliating approach to passenger safety .\nMany civil rights groups in addition to consumers rights organizations and air-travel business analysts feel very strongly that invasive security procedures violates passengers privacy .\nProfiling those individuals that are a real potential threat is a good way to avoid these problems .","debate_name":"This House supports security profiling at airports","claim_id":"17856_0"}
